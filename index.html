  <h1>Why learn to code?</h1>

  <p>In a world where we're surrounded by technology, and where so many of our interactions we have are with computers, learning to code helps us understand how these services work.</p>

  <p>What's more, learning to code gives us a powerful way to explore our ideas and make things, both for work and play.</p>

  <h1>Get involved</h1>

  <p>If you're part of a code club or group, and you're meeting during Code Week, <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/">tell us what you're doing</a> and we'll add it to our map.</p>

  <p>Not part of a group but want to take part? You can still run a Code Week event in your area. We've compiled <a href="/resources/">a list of guides and resources</a> which you might find useful. Community groups, companies and non-profits are all welcome to run a Code Week event.</p>

  <p>We've also got Code Week Ambassadors on the ground in every country. <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/ambassadors/">Get in touch with yours</a> if you'd like to volunteer, or if you'd like to sponsor a local event.</p>
