<p>Europe Code Week ambassadors encourage all the event organizers to tell their CodeWeek stories by making short videos and sharing them on YouTube.</p>

<p>The CodeWeekEU-2015 Video Contest provides an additional motivation to share and promote the videos in order to keed raising awareness of the importance of coding and computational thinking beyond Code Week.</p>

<p>You can take part in the competition with three kinds of videos: videos made during a CodeWeek event, videos reporting the effects of the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/odetocode/">"Ode to code" tune</a>, videos showing the results of a remix of the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/codeweekeu/">CodeWeekEU tutorial</a> on Scratch. The "Ode to code" is an open source music made to celebrate Europe Code Week. It can be freely added as a sound track to your video, or remixed to make your own music. All the resources you need for your project are available on <a href="http://codeweek.it/ode-to-code/">http://codeweek.it/ode-to-code/</a></p>
