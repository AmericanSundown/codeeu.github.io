The website was created with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's a Ruby gem
(library). To contribute:

2. Fork the repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
3. Clone the repository to your computer.
4. In the repository folder on your machine, run `bundle install` to have the
   project's dependencies installed.

After that, you can run the following command to preview locally the changes

Then open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) and you should be able to
