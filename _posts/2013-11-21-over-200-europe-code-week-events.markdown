This is just incredible: less than two weeks ago we happily [announced](http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/08/over-100-coding-opportunities-in-europe.html) over 100 coding opportunities with 60 events on the [Coding Map of Europe](/map). Well, that's old news now. At the moment of writing, the map already features **219 events** that will be taking place next week, November 25-30, all over Europe. All these events will help beginners of all ages learn new digital skills and [code their own future](http://coderdojo.com/news/eu-code-week-ireland).

We are extremely thankful for this incredible response from countless organizations, institutions and individuals, who are willing to share the joy of coding, often in their spare time, with little or no budget. If you're as inspired as we are about what's going on, keep in mind that there are still a few days left to plan your #codeEU event and join the coding movement next week. 

And remember, two is a group already! Yesterday, an [inspiring photo](https://www.facebook.com/codeEU/posts/416096991849882) was posted on our Facebook page with a story about a small group of six 9-10 year old kids in Brussels, who are learning Scratch with the help of their parents. This is exactly what Europe Code Week is all about! 

And while Ireland and Croatia are still contributing a large number of events, we're happy to report new events are also being added in Bulgaria, Malta, Italy, Netherlands, Lithuania and elsewhere. Check out the [Coding Map of Europe](/map) for more, add your event, and <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">send us</a> the basic info if you want to see your event or initiative featured on your [country's page](/learn). 

You can also help us by spreading the word about #codeEU and convince your non-coding friends to join one of the events next week or start learning online. Let's get Europe coding!
