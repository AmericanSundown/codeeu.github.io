Today **the 300th #codeEU event** was added to the [Coding Map of Europe](/map). Together with almost 70 other coding initiatives going on throughout the year, we now have almost 400 learning opportunities mapped across Europe!

While these numbers are pretty impressive, it really is about the small moments at each of your events that make all of this worthwhile. 

The GEMS Academy Etoy in Switzerland was again busy with various coding activities. We especially enjoyed this photo of grade 4 kids sharing their Hopscotch tricks with the 2nd graders.

More smiles came our way from Milltown N.S. Galway in Ireland, where again kids were helping other kids learn. After this, how could you not keep on coding?

And it seems like the young coders in Dublin were also enjoying their #codeEU day very much!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We did a lot of coding today!

You also shared a lot of cool projects that were made during the day. Our favorite one is this Vine that shows a real world version of the popular mobile game [Light-bot](http://light-bot.com/), which teaches coding principles in a fun way. If you aren't yet familiar with it, you should give it a try, to see the full brilliance of this Vine, created by the students at St. Oliver's Community College in Drogheda, Ireland.

Another interesting Vine came from [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) in Berlin, where adult hackers (we're sure they're very young at hearts though!) teach each other how to become better coders. Today they were playing with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) to create a cool programmable display.

At St. Peter's Primary School in Bray, Ireland, they experimented with [MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) invention kits and other tools.

And in St. John’s National School in Ballisodare, Ireland they made an interactive Christmas greeting. This year, the kids will be able to code their own greeting cards!

Today was also day 1 of [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) workshops in Munich, Germany and Brno, Czech Republic. The Munich girls tweeted this big #fridayhug during their installation party. They'll be doing even more exciting things tomorrow while building their first web app!

The weekend will be also very exciting for us due to a large number of [CoderDojos](http://coderdojo.com/) taking place all over Europe. For inspiration, we suggest tuning in to this podcast interview with Julie Cullen, our Irish #codeEU ambassador.

And if you are interested in the background of #codeEU, watch the highlights of the presentation of Europe Code Week made by Alja Isaković, Slovenian #codeEU ambassador, for Neelie Kroes' [Digital Champions](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital-champions) earlier this week.
