[Ireland](/learn/ireland), the home of [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com/), is going for gold! Starting as one of the most active Europe Code Week countries, it even took over [The Web Summit](http://websummit.net), Europe's biggest tech conference with over 10,000 attendees. 

[Julie Cullen](https://twitter.com/cullej29), Irish Code Week Ambassador and Neelie Kroes' Young Advisor, was busy promoting Europe Code Week at this year's Web Summit in partnership with CoderDojo. Ireland already has over 200 organizations taking part in Europe Code Week from November 25-30 and they are inviting YOU to join the challenge and add existing or new events to our [Europe Coding Map](http://codeweek.eu/map/).

If you're not yet familiar with the amazing work CoderDojo is doing in Ireland and elsewhere, we believe Europe Code Week is a great excuse to [start](http://coderdojo.com/get-involved) and give young people in your community a chance to start coding early.
