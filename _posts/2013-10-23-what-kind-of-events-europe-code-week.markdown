That's the number one question we've been getting in the past few days. The short answer is: anything goes, as long as it's about getting people excited about computer programming!

Your event can be a lecture on how to start coding. A beginner workshop. For kids, women, your parents. A developer meet up with beginner topics. Just try to make it accessible for those who have never tried coding before and might even be a bit afraid to `print` their first `"Hello world"` in the Terminal.

To give you a few ideas:

- we have a WordPress workshop confirmed for Code Week in [Sweden](http://codeweek.eu/learn/sweden);
- Mozilla Space in [Slovenia](http://codeweek.eu/learn/slovenia) is hosting a workshop on [Mozilla WebMaker](http://webmaker.org), a tool that helps you create the web; 
- CoderDojos are rocking all over [Ireland](http://codeweek.eu/learn/ireland) and getting kids excited about code; 
- women in [Luxembourg](http://codeweek.eu/learn/luxembourg) will be able to participate in an Intro to Web Dev workshop;
- University of Nicosia in [Cyprus](http://codeweek.eu/learn/cyprus) is opening their doors to high school students with a series of lectures and workshops on software development hosted by graduates;
- [@zilvertoon](https://twitter.com/codeweekeu/status/392686855105576960) is looking for a place in Antwerp, [Belgium](http://codeweek.eu/learn/belgium) that can host coding classes for less privileged children. (Know anyone that can help? Get in touch!) 

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. So, it's totally up to you to come up with your event or start a new chapter of a global movement like [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com) or [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com). Feel free to be inspired by existing initiatives, mix and match to create something that your city needs. You don't need a special permission from us to start something, the event doesn't even have to be strictly between November 25-30.

In short, you know your city best, and you probably already have a group in mind that you'd like to help. If you are looking for help, let us know and we'll ask for help through our network. There are people out there who are willing to help, we just need you to make the choice and create the first spark. The time to act is now, we are all responsible for raising the digital literacy of Europe. 

And if you already have success stories from your community, no matter how big or small, send them our way, so we can share some inspiration through our network.

**Let's get Europe coding!**
