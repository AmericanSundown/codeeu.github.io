If you read the [About](/about) page, you know the official answer: "The initiative was launched by [Neelie Kroes' Young Advisors](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors) with the support from [DG Connect](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/en/content/dg-connect) at the European Commission". The Young Advisors are a diverse group of young people from all over Europe, who advise VP Kroes on everything related to the [Digital Agenda for Europe](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/).

But we wanted to do more than just advise. So we came up with the idea of Europe Code Week, launched it in record time as an open source project, and we're helping people learn about coding at various #codeEU events in our own countries this week.

We kicked off Code Week with a meeting with DG Connect in Brussels to present and discuss the project, and to start planning for an even better Code Week next year. You want to meet some of the #codeEU ambassadors from your country?

Third from the left is [Janne Elvelid](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50636), #codeEU ambassador from Sweden. Next to him [Gyula Vamosi](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50634), who is busy bringing coding skills to the Roma community across Europe. Sixth from the left is [Alja Isaković](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50628), #codeEU ambassador from Slovenia and the driving force of the initiative. Next to her, in the middle, [Julie Cullen](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50641), #codeEU ambassador from Ireland, who's holding a special vase made of Galway glass, engraved with the EU Code Week Ireland logo. On Julie's right [Luis Iván Cuende](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50646) and [Alberto Elías](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50652) from Spain, who are planning another exciting project for young coders (more on that soon!). On their right is [Jana Huisman](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/jana-huisman), originally from Netherlands, but currently studying and promoting #codeEU in Germany, followed by [Renata Danieliene](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50649) behind her, who's been helping with the [National Digital Coalition in Lithuania](http://www.eu2013.lt/en/news/pressreleases/national-digital-coalition-will-promote-wider-use-of-modern-technologies) and by [Maria Prekopova](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50715) from Slovakia.

We were missing Young Advisors [Mercedes Díaz Sánchez](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50709) (Belgium), [Anna Mazgal](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50613) (Poland), [Lucie Jagu](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50644) (France and Austria), [Jordan Hatch](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50637) (UK) and [Gabriel Dragomir](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/50633) (Romania), who also acted as #codeEU ambassadors in their own countries. We also wanted to use this opportunity to thank #codeEU ambassadors from other countries, who aren't Young Advisors. Especially Ivana Ružić from Croatia, who is doing a fantastic job at promoting #codeEU in [Croatian schools](https://www.facebook.com/CodeWeekHr).

During our meeting in Brussels we had a lot of interesting discussions and ideas. Do you want to know what's coming up for Europe Code Week next year? Well, it's a bit too soon to tell. But the success of this year has certainly proven that Europe needs a Code Week, if not a whole month or year, so we'll be rolling up our sleeves again in the coming months. You can help us by [sending in](mailto:{{site.contact.email}}) inspiring stories with tips from your #codeEU events or your own ideas for the future of #codeEU.
