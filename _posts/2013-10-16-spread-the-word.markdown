We've started adding various coding initiatives to the website. [Sweden](http://codeweek.eu/learn/sweden/) already has a few confirmed Code Week events, [Ireland's](http://codeweek.eu/learn/ireland/) CoderDojos are planning something big as well, [Bulgaria's](http://codeweek.eu/learn/bulgaria/) Telerik sent us info about their amazing coding Academies for various age groups, [Slovenia](http://codeweek.eu/learn/slovenia/) is having its first Internet Week Ljubljana in the coming days.

But we know there's more great things happening out there. We now need your help to spread the word about Europe Code Week and add your initiatives and events to the website. You can now find the initial set of resources, including the first press release draft, on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeeu/codeeu.github.io/tree/master/resources). Feel free to add your own translation, we're still waiting for our first Pull Request :)
