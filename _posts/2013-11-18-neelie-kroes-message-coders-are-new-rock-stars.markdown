*"From simulating stars to simulating shopping - from finding your way through the traffic to finding the Higgs boson. Coding is a new life skill and coders are the new rock stars."*

That's the [message](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfxWn4YHXt4) Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission for the [Digital Agenda](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/), decided to share with everyone involved with #codeEU. Watch her welcome message and words of support below.

On Neelie's blog, you can also read a special guest blog post, written by Alja Isaković, Neelie Kroes' Young advisor and #codeEU ambassador from Slovenia: **[Will we code our own future or just wait for jobs to disappear?](http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/will-we-code-our-own-future-or-just-wait-jobs-disappear)**

Meanwhile, Ireland is still one of the most active countries. EU Code Week Ireland was officially launched today at a [special event](http://www.finegael.ie/latest-news/2013/ireland-should-aim-to-set/index.xml) by An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny TD; Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Ciarán Cannon; and Neelie Kroes' Young advisor and #codeEU ambassador from Ireland, Julie Cullen, who wrote an excellent guest blog post for the [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com/) website: **[EU Code Week in Ireland](http://coderdojo.com/news/eu-code-week-ireland)**.
