                                        The result of this lecture will be co-creation of a simple computer program to exemplify basic coding functions present in all coding languages.

                                        For a well functioning program efficiency is the key feature. On examples we will demonstrate how to assess algorithm efficiency.

                                        <em>Theory of Numbers and Cryptography by Jakub Pawlewicz</em>:
                                        It is hard to imagine today’s world without encryption and e-signatures. Why would banks care about the theory of numbers? We will describe their basic mechanisms that are a foundation of modern cryptography.
