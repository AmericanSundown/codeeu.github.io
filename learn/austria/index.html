                                <strong>Coding websites: skills within 60 minutes</strong> by <a href="http://kerstinkollmann.com/">Kerstin Kollmann</a><br>
                                When people talk about "the internet" today, they mostly mean the World Wide Web, a huge network of (interlinked) websites. What all websites have in common, regardless of their purpose, is that they are documents based on the same language. This workshop's objective is to offer you a look "behind the scenes" of the WWW and help you get creative yourself by teaching you the basics of building websites.<br><u>Target audience:</u> Beginners to HTML and CSS.<br><u>Prerequisites:</u> None. Please bring your own laptop if possible.
